watering office plants lol

--Edits If needed:
Change the interface and method for the Operations Class
1. public string WaterPlant --> async string WaterPlant (make private and access through public channel)
2. change the Program Class Main method call to WaterPlant to the below
--- _plantOperations.WaterPlant(plantId).Wait();
--- ** surround in Try/Catch for more handling **
